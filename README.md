# UTOR-MOD02-CHAL01-Developer-Website
University of Toronto - Coding Bootcamp - Module 02 - Challenge 01 - Developer Website code

## Description

Reporsitory containing the code for the developer's profile website. The website is done purely in HTML and CSS taking advantage of the Flexbox design to ensure the website is compatible with all modern devices - desktop, tables, or smart phone. A proper website is important for any developer seeking to find employment in a company or attract clients to their business.

The website is divided into four main sections:
- Header: showing the developer image, name, and links to the various sections of the website
- Banner: showing a sample code screen shot with a cool tag line
- Articles: showing the main content of the webpage with developer's short bio, samples of the work completed so far, and links to contact the developer
- Footer: showing a simple copyright message in order for the website to have a complete look and feel

## Functionality
The following discusses some of the features of the website and how it responds to various devices. This section will not discuss how text boxes "shrink" in response to a different device, but will focus on how elements get rearranged based on device.
### Portfolio section:
- Desktop: when viewed in a desktop, the most recent project (i.e. the first project in the list) will appear in full width; any additional project will show underneath with a maximum number of THREE per row
- Tablet: when viewed in a tablet, the most recent project (i.e. the first project in the list) will appear in full width; any additional project will show underneath with a maximum number of TWO per row
- Smart phone: all projects will appear one below the other and occupy the width of the screen. There is no special emphasis for the most recent project

Projects with active links will "shrink" a little once the user hovers over them. For illustrative purposes, "coming soon" projects have been added to show the functionality.

### Contact Me section:
- Desktop: when viewed in a desktop, the contact me form will occupy roughly 75% of the available space and the social media icons - the rest of the space. The social media icons will show in a column.
- Tablet: when viewed in a tablet, the contact me form will occupy 100% of the available space and the social media icons will be below. The social media icons will show in a row.
- Smart phone: when viewed in a smart phone, the contact me form will occupy 100% of the available space and the social media icons will be below. The social media icons will show in a row.

As of right now, the contact me form does not send the written message to the developer.
